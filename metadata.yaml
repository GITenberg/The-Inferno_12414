description: A lone young man spies through a hole in the wall of his hotel room.
  Through it he witnesses all possible events of life, such as marriage, death, lesbianism,
  adultery and incest. The story was condemned on its English release as gross voyeurism,
  but can also be read as the education of one isolated individual in the tragedy
  of life.
